# Product API â€” TypeScript & Express Example

A simple TypeScript + Express API that demonstrates clean separation of concerns with **controllers**, **services**, and **utils**.  
The API manages an in-memory list of products (generated with [`@faker-js/faker`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker)) and implements basic CRUD operations and field filtering.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Generate fake product data at startup
- REST API with CRUD endpoints:
  - Create, Read (all/one), Update, Delete
- Filter product fields via query params (e.g. `?filter=name,price`)
- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Clear project structure (controllers, services, utils, interfaces)
